# Prepare repository work tracking and delivery

Revision: 0.1.4 · Updated: 2026-10-09

Inspect the actual repository, owner, default branch, existing instructions,
checks, labels, Projects and deployment rules. Preserve established conventions.
Use GitHub's native CLI/API/UI; Factory has no label cache or workflow database.
Check the authorized account and exact destination before changing them.

## Qualify the connection

GitHub authentication belongs to the OS account running the execution service.
Check `gh auth status` there, then read the intended repository, a relevant issue
or PR and its checks. Git fetch/push credentials and Project permissions are
separate capabilities; test the read paths and qualify writes only as part of an
authorized action. A browser login or successful Git clone does not establish all
of them. Reuse adequate existing credentials and request only missing access.
Never print tokens or copy a personal credential store into the execution account.

Before the first commit, check `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` and
`git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT` in the intended checkout. GitHub login does not
configure commit attribution. If missing or wrong, use the approved identity at
the selected repository or execution-account scope; preserve existing overrides.
Use the account's [GitHub-provided noreply address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
when privacy is needed. Never invent an author. Read back the identity on the
first authorized commit; no extra test commit or credential change is required.

For T3 0.0.45, use **Settings → Source Control → Rescan** after authenticating on
the server, then confirm its account/status in that environment. This is native
GitHub integration; there is no separate Factory login. See
[T3 source control](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/v0.0.45/docs/user/source-control.md).

## One work-status source

Choose the existing GitHub Project's **Status** field as the reference workflow.
For a new project, a useful starting set is Not planned, Triaging, Ready,
In progress, Review and Done. These are defaults to adapt, not hardcoded runtime
states. The source is the Project field and its actual option IDs. Put Not planned
before Triaging; keep it open for parked ideas with a revisit trigger.

Record the human admission decision or its explicit delegation before moving
implementation work to Ready. Use Triaging for active assessment and research;
untouched or deliberately parked ideas can remain Not planned with a revisit trigger.
Track a concrete dependency or owner decision in the issue; do not turn all parked
ideas into blocked tasks. Read the accepted priority before picking backlog work.

Use labels for useful categories such as bug, feature, research, security and
scope/area. Reuse real names and colors from GitHub. Avoid a second set of labels
that mirrors Status. A GitHub edit is reflected natively without Factory syncing it.

Inspect first, then create only missing resources. For a new org Project:

```sh
gh project list --owner YOUR_ORG
gh project create --owner YOUR_ORG --title "Factory" --format json
gh project link PROJECT_NUMBER --owner YOUR_ORG --repo YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO
gh project field-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner YOUR_ORG --format json
```

Replace the placeholders with inspected identifiers. Do not repeat creation after
an unknown response; list and reconcile first. In the Project UI, edit the existing
Status options, create a Board view grouped by Status, and save useful filtered
views. The GraphQL API is available for supported field/item operations. Read the
settings back; a guide or local JSON file does not configure GitHub.

Projects needs the account's applicable Project access. For a GitHub CLI OAuth
login that lacks the scope, deliberately request it with
`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project`; listing alone can use `read:project`.
Use the appropriate permissions for other token types. For a user-owned Project,
use `--owner @me` instead of an organization name. Do not repeat login when the
current authorized account already has sufficient access.

If adopting an existing field, map its actual semantics rather than renaming
historical work without a migration. Closing as `not_planned` is declined work,
not delivered Done. Configure built-in workflows accordingly: an unconditional
closed-issue → Done rule can erase that distinction. An open backlog field and a
GitHub closure reason are different records.

## Admission and automation

An issue can come from anyone with access to the repository. Identify trusted
owner decisions independently from its body. The initial route is explicit:
give the lead the issue or an accepted backlog with its execution mandate.

For later webhook/scheduled intake, use a qualified native T3/harness facility.
Authenticate the sender, bound repositories/actions, read current state and
reconcile duplicate delivery. A valid GitHub webhook signature authenticates the
event, not every issue author's instruction. Do not place a persistent agent on
an untrusted PR runner or build another Factory queue.

## Checks and delivery

Use the application's real test/build/lint checks. Keep workflow permissions
minimal, dependencies/actions reviewed and pinned, execution bounded and secrets
out of untrusted PRs. Do not carry Factory's method-validation workflow into an
application as a substitute for meaningful application tests.
Identify the relevant dependency-update and vulnerability-response route. Inspect
effective workflow/token permissions, and native dependency alerts and secret
scanning/push protection where available and appropriate. Distinguish configured,
observed and unavailable controls; do not enable paid services or treat a scanner
score as a security guarantee.

Configure actual branch rules/required checks and applicable deployment protections
in GitHub. Read them back. A workflow file alone does not enable those controls.
Record plan/access limitations without changing billing or repository visibility.
One person's accounts may be unable to approve their own PR: independent model
review and GitHub-required review are distinct. Preserve configured controls;
do not bypass them to claim the autonomous path works.

Before delivery, identify the exact reviewed candidate, check results, owner or
delegated acceptance, destination and recovery. Refresh affected proof after
changes/rebase. Read back the merge/release and, when in scope, verify actual
installed behavior. Published, installed and validated are different states.
Update affected delivery documentation to match the observed revision/environment.
An untested deployment, rollback or restore remains unverified; publishing a release
does not advance those verification dates. Retain private evidence at its approved
location and link only a safe summary from public documentation.

## Contributor credit

Keep the human author and use the native Co-authored-by attribution for harnesses
that actually contributed. Preserve these trailers when squashing. Codex's native
identity is `Codex <noreply@openai.com>`; retain Claude's actual native selected
model identity when it contributed. Do not invent another harness's email or
rewrite history just to populate a graph. Review-only participation belongs in
the PR's review evidence.

This is attribution, not another GitHub login or permission boundary. GitHub
associates commit emails with accounts and applies default-branch/contributor
rules, so a visible trailer need not immediately create a separate avatar in the
contributors graph. A shared credential still has its actual shared grants.
